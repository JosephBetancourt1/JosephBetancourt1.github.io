Im a student learning computer science to hopefully get into a big tech company and be a great use to society with my ethical uses of programming.

# favorite labs:

Lab 11 part-1

This lab made me think out of the box but guided me enough to finish the lab.
I learned how to use the pushback function and how to incorporate it the code.
The overall lab made me and my partner struggle to find the right variables and their places but with the help of the TA we got through.

Lab 8 part-1

I found this lab easier than others but it showed me the key principles. By using if statements we 
just created simple ifâ€™s to give the error message if the proper input wasn't given. This showed how code can be used in ethicals ways in real life situations.

Lab 2 part-1 

This was my third favorite cause of its simplicity but ill always remember when i thought it was just inputs and outputs. The key idea was just if this was inputed output this and if not then display error. The lab will be like my version of hello world for me to show others how i started out.
